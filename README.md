# Data Modeling with Cassandra

## Summary of project
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database that can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring on the project. My role is to create a database for this analysis. I'll be able to test my database by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

## Project Overview
In this project, I'll apply data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, I will need to model my data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. I are provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
